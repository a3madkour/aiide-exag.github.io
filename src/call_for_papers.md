# Call for Papers

EXAG 2023 will be accepting papers to three different tracks:

* **Full papers** -- Regular papers submitted for oral presentation (up to seven pages in length, with the seventh page containing only references). These papers will be incorporated into the proceedings and will be presented as 10-minute talks with 5 minutes of Q&A.

* **Short papers** -- Short papers (up to four pages) describing a position, project, or proposal related to any topic of interest to the workshop. These papers will be incorporated into the proceedings and will be presented as 5-minute talks with 3 minutes of Q&A.

* **Lightning talks** -- (One-page extended abstract) Presenters are given 5 minutes to present on a relevant topic of interest. Examples of talk formats are calls to action, explanations of design spaces, deep dives, and opinion talks.

Papers will be presented in groups based on their topics. The ordering of topics may depend on speaker availability,
especially when accommodating remote presenters. Lightning talks will happen in the afternoon session and are designed to spark conversation prior to attendees dismissing for evening activities.

## Important Dates

Deadline for paper submissions:  **July 3rd, 2023**

Notification for accepted papers: **August 7th, 2023**

Publication-ready submission due: **September 4th, 2023**

Workshop date: **October 8th, 2023**

## Topics

We are pleased to be a broad workshop with a large range of topics covered, and we aim to continue and expand our scope this year. This is a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest to EXAG:

* The development of new game systems made possible by AI, from roguelike Unexplored’s procedurally-generated dungeons and puzzles to stealth game Third Eye Crime’s visualization of AI logic.

* The use of AI in support of mixed-initiative co-creative play experiences, including collaborative storytelling games like Bad News.

* Better living through AI—improving game development and design through new and interesting applications of AI, from intelligent design tools to automated QA.

* Discussion of experimental AI technologies used in games and play environments that may extend beyond the digital space into physical, embodied environments. Examples include (but are not limited to) AI in games that involve tangible user interfaces, interactive play spaces like museums, or embodied gameplay in virtual or augmented reality environments.

* Cross-pollination from AI subfields not typically used in games, like computational linguistics, machine vision,
and procedural music.

* Traditional AI techniques applied in new ways that break genre conventions, like Left 4 Dead’s drama management or Black And White’s learning creatures.

* Human-centered evaluation of intelligent systems for digital entertainment.

* Discussion of interesting but relatively unknown historical examples of experimental AI in games and related areas. Here, we are especially interested in examples from the game industry, such as Captain Blood’s (1988) modular icon-based interface for procedural communication with NPCs, Intellivision World Series Baseball’s (1983) telecast-influenced procedural camera system, or Skool Daze’s (1984) real-time simulation of NPC agendas. In some cases, the investigation may reveal that these historical examples actually represent the state of the art in game AI today.

* Reports on failed experiments related to any topic in our purview, with insight into what went wrong and how others can learn from the failure.

* Industry case studies in which non-academic developers present their applications of experimental game AI in commercial game contexts.

Previous work presented at EXAG includes dynamic NPC knowledge modeling, blending or inventing game designs, intelligent design tools, hybrid generative algorithms, formal logics for games, generation of procedural game entities, procedural game narratives, and more.
